# Implementing a CNN for Human Activity Recognition in Keras and Tensorflow
This notebook was based of tutorial on https://www.kdnuggets.com/2016/11/implementing-cnn-human-activity-recognition-tensorflow.html

The notebook shows how CNN was implemented using Keras and Tensorflow. The notebook uses Actitracker data set released by Wireless Sensor Data Mining (WISDM) lab. This dataset contains six daily activities collected in a controlled laboratory environment. The activities include jogging, walking, ascending stairs, descending stairs, sitting and standing. The data is collected from 36 users using a smartphone in their pocket with the 20Hz sampling rate.

The notebook as my explanation of how this CNN has been implemented using Keras, and how confusion matrix was created using scikit learn.
